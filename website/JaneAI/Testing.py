text = """A solar eclipse is a natural astronom ical event that occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun , tempor arily obsc uring the Sun ' s light . During a solar eclipse , the observer on Earth will see the Sun appear to be either partially or fully covered by the Moon , depending on the type of eclipse .
There are three main types of solar e cli ps es :
1 . Total Sol ar Eclipse : This happens when the Moon completely covers the Sun , as seen from Earth . The sky gets dark as if it were night in the path of tot ality ( the area experien cing the total eclipse ), and the typical features of the Sun , such as the cor ona , become visible . The cor ona is the Sun ' s outer most atmosphere , usually seen only during a total solar eclipse .
2 . Part ial Sol ar Eclipse : During a partial solar eclipse , only a part of the Sun is covered by the Moon . Ob ser vers experiences a partial covering of the solar disk . This phenomen on happens within the bro ader area guaranteed by an ann ular solar eclipse .
3 . Ann ular Sol ar Eclipse : This occurs when the Moon covers the center of the Sun , but the edges do not align properly , leaving a ring - like appearance known as the " ring of fire ." The reason for this angle dis cre p ancy lies in the Moon ' s elli pt ical orbit around the Earth ; at some points , it ' s further from Earth and appears smaller in the sky , unable to block the bright photos phere .
S olar e cli ps es only happen during the new Moon phase and can be seen with the right equipment , such as eclipse glass es , solar filters , or by project ing the image through a pin hole project or . It ' s cru cial not to look directly at the Sun without proper protection , even during an eclipse â€” using solar view ing materials can prevent serious eye damage .
D ue to the distances and sizes involved , solar e cli ps es don ' t happen every month ( even though the new Moon phase occurs every month ), but rather about twice a year at points of intersection of the Moon ' s orbit with the e cli ptic plane ( the apparent path of the Sun across our sky ).
The beautiful a we - in sp iring spect acle of a solar eclipse leaves a last ing impression on anyone fort un ate enough to witness it , although prepar ation and ca ution are vital to ensure safe observation"""
